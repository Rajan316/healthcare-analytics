Over the course of the past decade the ability to translate data into insights has quickly become a highly in-demand skill by all. This 6-day Healthcare Analytics bootcamp aims at extracting useful insights from the health care domain and also provides tools to enable analytics in the medical domain for ailments that are the frequent norm of this generation.

## Below are the projects that we have executed for this bootcamp:

### 1. [Framingham case study](https://github.com/Rajan316/healthcare-analytics/tree/master/Framingham)

The <a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/">Framingham Heart Study (FHS)</a> is dedicated to identifying common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). <br />
We will build models using the Framingham data to predict and prevent heart disease that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). <br /> In this project, students will have a glimpse into how Framingham data be used to help predict the future risk of a patient contracting cardiac disease through machine learning models.
