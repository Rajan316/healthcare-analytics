# healthcare-analytics
The project aims at performing analytics on various medical databases.
# Framingham case study
We will build models using the Framingham data to predict and prevent heart disease. <br />
5,209 patients aged 30-59 were enrolled in the Framingham heart disease prediction Case study.<br />
Patients were given questionnaire and exam every 2 years and were asked to write down:<br />
• Physical characteristics<br />
• Behavioral characteristics<br />
• Test results<br />
Exams and questions expanded over time.<br />

# Good health case Study
We build a machine learning model using the Pima Indians Diabets dataset in order to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.<br />
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.<br />

## Dataset description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.<br />

# Hepatitis case Study
We build a machine learning model to understand survival statistics of those who contract hepatitis.
