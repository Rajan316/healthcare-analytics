# healthcare-analytics
The project aims at performing analytics on various medical databases.
# Framingham case study
We build a machine learning model using the Framingham data to predict heart disease for any patient.
# Good health case Study
We build a machine learning model using the Pima Indians Diabets dataset in order to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
# Hepatitis case Study
We build a machine learning model to understand survival statistics of those who contract hepatitis.

# Algorithms 
The machine learning algorithms used in these projects are:
<br />
  1. Logistic regression for classification<br />
  2. K Nearest Neighbours algorithm<br />
