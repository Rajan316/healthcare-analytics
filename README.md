# healthcare-analytics
The project aims at performing analytics on various medical databases.
# Framingham case study
We will build models using the Framingham data to predict and prevent heart disease. <br />
5,209 patients aged 30-59 were enrolled in the Framingham heart disease prediction Case study.<br />
Patients were given questionnaire and exam every 2 years and were asked to write down:<br />
• Physical characteristics<br />
• Behavioral characteristics<br />
• Test results<br />
Exams and questions expanded over time.<br />

# Good health case Study
We build a machine learning model using the Pima Indians Diabets dataset in order to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

# Hepatitis case Study
We build a machine learning model to understand survival statistics of those who contract hepatitis.

# Algorithms 
The machine learning algorithms used in these projects are:
<br />
  1. Logistic regression for classification<br />
  2. K Nearest Neighbours algorithm<br />
