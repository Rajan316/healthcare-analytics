The Framingham Heart Study was started in 1948 under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). The initial study recruited 5,209 men and women between 30 and 62 years of age. Researchers asked participants questions about their general health, medications and asked about illnesses, including cancer.<br />
Patients were given a questionnaire and exam every 2 years and were asked to write down:<br />
• Physical characteristics<br />
• Behavioral characteristics<br />
• Test results<br />

## Objective
Framingham case study aims to predict whether or not a patient has a risk of coronary heart disease within a span of 10 years. 

## Dataset description
The dataset is a small subset of possible FHS dataset, having 4240 observations and 16 variables. <br /> 

### Attributes:
1. gender : the gender of the observations. The variable is a binary named “male” in the dataset.
2. age : Age at the time of medical examination in years.
3. education : A categorical variable of the participants education, with the levels: Some high school (1), high school/GED (2), some college/vocational school (3), college (4)
4. currentSmoker: Current cigarette smoking at the time of examinations
5. cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked each day
6. BPmeds: Use of Anti-hypertensive medication at exam
7. prevalentStroke: Prevalent Stroke (0 = free of disease)
8. prevalentHyp: Prevalent Hypertensive. Subject was defined as hypertensive if treated
9. diabetes: Diabetic according to criteria of first exam treated
10. totChol: Total cholesterol (mg/dL)
11. sysBP: Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
12. diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
13. BMI: Body Mass Index, weight (kg)/height (m)^2
14. heartRate: Heart rate (beats/minute)
15. glucose: Blood glucose level (mg/dL)
16. TenYearCHD : The 10 year risk of coronary heart disease(CHD).
